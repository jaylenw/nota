Pull request and issues are welcomed. Please make sure you are able to run the unit tests with all passing before raising a PR.
Add or modify unit tests sensibly if needed. As well, be descriptive in your PR description and tag any relevant issues.
Before making changes for a pull request, create or note an issue first, and use the issue number to create a new branch with
the issue number in the branch name (ex. ghi-{issuenumber}, ghi-22} to include your work in. Thank you! :)
